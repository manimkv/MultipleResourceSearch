# MultipleResourceSearch
Multiple Resource Search REST API using Python.

The idea behind the project is to create the ability to search multiple resources sites parallely for a single request made to your API.
 

Resource sites are :

    Google
    Duckduckgo
    Twitter 



Tips:

Pass asynch=1 in Get request as a parameter to run the search in asynchronous mode.
